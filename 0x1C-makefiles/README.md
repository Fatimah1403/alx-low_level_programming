rules: all
The all rule builds your executable
variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME
CC: the compiler to be used
SRC: the .c files
OBJ: the .o files
NAME: the name of the executable
The all rule should recompile only the updated source files

re: forces recompilation of all source files
variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM
CC: the compiler to be used
SRC: the .c files
OBJ: the .o files
NAME: the name of the executable
RM: the program to delete files
The all rule should recompile only the updated source files

Whiteboard first
Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

grid is a list of list of integers:
0 represents a water zone
1 represents a land zone
One cell is a square with side length 1
Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100
Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water around the island).
Requirements:

First line contains #!/usr/bin/python3
You are not allowed to import any module
Module and function must be documented
